Beer Trader Service
======
The Beer Trader Service is the server component of the Beer Trader Project.  The purpose of Beer Trader is to allow beer enthusiasts the ability to find people with whom to trade specialty, home brew, or other difficult to find beers.  The app is conceptually similar to Tinder; however, instead of dealing in social interaction, Beer Trader's currency is of the more fermented variety.

The server component of the project is a web application that exposes a secure REST service.  It is through this central service that the mobile application interacts.  

The server component is composed of the following technologies:

1. J2EE
2. Neo4J (https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j)
3. Jersey (https://github.com/jersey/jersey)
4. Jackson (https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson)
